##  B. ABSTRACT 

Todayâ€™s institutions are facing major security issues; consequently, they need several specially trained personnel to attain the desired security. These personnel, as human beings, make mistakes that might affect the level of security. 
A proposed solution to the mentioned matter is a Face Recognition Security System, which can detect intruders to restricted or high - security areas and help in minimizing human error.
This project is about an anti-theft security system using face recognition based on Raspberry pi. Anti-theft security system has been launched for many years but most of them are just a CCTV, IP camera or door sensor alert system. It could be more efficient with uses of face recognition. The design of anti-theft security system is based on human face recognition and remote monitoring technology. It will verify the person identity that goes near to the camera within certain distance. Only the people who match the identity with database and key in the correct password have the right to entry. A mobile application telegram and image processing technique LBP based have been involved in this system. Electric door lock solenoid, keypad and LCD display will combined operate the accessibility of door. An ultrasonic sensor is used to detect the person distance between the door. Face recognition will only start to function when someone goes near the door within certain distance. An alert message and photo taken will send to owner mobile phone via telegram with WIFI when the face recognition algorithms detect a stranger comes near the door and also a buzzer will be triggered to act as an alarm system. Owner can control the door locker and check the camera with the telegram application. The security system is designed for actual use in home condition with the uses of a microcontroller ARM Quad Cortex-A53.

## C.  INTRODUCTION

This project is for provide a precise solution with a new design with improvement embedded system to protect the household with giving higher security level and notification on time. Anyway, there are a few problems that are still exist on security product on market. The issues like the face detection only will start to function when someone press the doorbell. Surveillance system will destroy by theft and without notify owner when stranger come in. Lastly, face recognition can be passed with owner face photo. 
Nowadays, the home security with only door locker is not enough to protect your house and family. However, the smart home security system on market still not popular for household uses because of the high price tag. Besides that, the smart home security system on market still can be improved to higher security level and build with low-cost material to fulfil the need of market. Regarding to this issue, anti-theft security system using face recognition project have been started for solve this issue. It can help to solve the issues like it can trigger the alarm and capture an image send to owner when a stranger is detected in front of door. The theft will get alert so he got no time to start breaking the door and destroy the security system. For overcome the weakness of face recognition that can be passed with owner face image so the door will only unlock with the correct password input with a keypad.


## D.  PROJECT SCOPE

The scope of this project is developing an embedded system with the implement of face recognition algorithm. This project involves a new design with low-cost material but higher security level. Hence, it was design to against the weakness of security system on market. The boundary or coverage of this project was limited to household uses. The design architecture, the structure of the embedded system and the programming skill are included in this project.

## E. PROJECT OBJECTIVES 
Despite of there are many similar products are available in the market, however there are still a lot of improvement can be done. The objectives of this project are: 

1.To design and develop an anti-theft security system which is portable, high efficiency, low cost and easy to operate. 

2.To detect the present of person when he or she reach in front the door and the face recognizer will recognize owner face. 

3.To notify owner and start surveillance system in real time when stranger detected. 

4.To record the door access about time, user and locker status. 

5.To have door access time restrictions.





## F.   ACHIEVEMENT

1. Face detect and face recognition successful implement on door lock system. 
2. A door lock system which unlock and lock the door by using phone, keypad or remote has been implemented. 
3. Surveillance cam has been implemented on this system. 
4. A low cost and efficient security system successful build. 
5. A door access audit trail system successful build. 
6. A time restrictions system has been integrated on this security system.
